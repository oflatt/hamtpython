# hamtpython
An implementation of the HAMT data structure in Python to test how varying node sizes affects its performance.
The hamt.py file is an uncompressed, simple version of the data structure.
The compressedhamt.py file uses a bitmap to compress each node.
The pythondictionarytest.py file can be used to benchmark against python dictionaries.
It is best to compare results by running them in PyPy.
